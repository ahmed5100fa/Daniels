#Daniels - Responsive Landing Page

Daniels is a responsive landing page project developed as part of my first exam at Route Academy. Built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the page is designed to showcase fundamental web design principles, including mobile-first design, layout structure, and basic styling. The goal of the project was to create an adaptive, clean layout that works seamlessly across devices.

Key Features:

Fully responsive design using Bootstrap's grid system.
Clean and modern layout with a focus on user experience.
CSS styling to enhance visuals and structure.
This project serves as an introduction to responsive web development, highlighting essential skills for building functional websites.
